# Java 3D First-Person Shooter (FPS) Game

## Project Description
This is a 3D First-Person Shooter (FPS) game built in Java using raycasting techniques. The game features multiple levels with increasing difficulty, interactive environments (e.g., traps and movable objects), and a HUD that displays health and time. Additionally, it integrates a chatbot using text-to-speech for real-time narration, enhancing the player's experience.

## Features
- **Multiple Levels**: Progress through levels with unique layouts and increasing challenges.
- **Raycasting Rendering**: Real-time 3D environment rendering using 2D map data.
- **Interactive Environment**: Avoid traps and interact with certain objects within the game.
- **HUD**: Displays player's health, time, and progress through the level.
- **Chatbot Narration**: Chatbot provides real-time feedback and narration using FreeTTS.
